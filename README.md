# Zombie Panic! Source Translator Application

This application generates the required translation files in `.json` format, that the game `Zombie Panic! Source` uses. This only applies to version 3.x and higher.

Support for KeyValues importing and exporting (translation files that Source Engine uses by default), has been added for games other than `Zombie Panic! Source`.

## Requirements

* Qt 6.6.1 or higher.
* Visual Studio 2019 or higher.
* 64-Bit architecture.

## Building

Just open the project file with Qt Creator, choose Visual Studio 2019 (or higher) as your preferred compiler and start building the project.
